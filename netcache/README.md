# Overview
This is a part of the artifact that is used to evaluate OrbitCache, as described in the paper "Pushing the Limits of In-Network Caching for Key-Value Stores" in USENIX NSDI 2025.
This NetCache artifact is not a full implementation of NetCache at SOSP 2017. Unlike the original NetCache, this artifact implements the cache lookup table and the cache memory in the ingress pipeline that accesses 64-B memory regions.
